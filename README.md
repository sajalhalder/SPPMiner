#  Supergraph based Periodic Patterns Mining (SPPMiner)
In this paper, we propose single pass supergraph based periodic pattern mining SPPMiner technique that is polynomial unlike most graph mining problems. The proposed technique stores all entities in dynamic networks only once and calculate common sub-patterns once at each timestamps. In this way, it works faster. The performance study shows that SPPMiner method is time and memory efficient compared to others. In fact, the memory efficiency of our approach does not depend on dynamic networkâ€™s lifetime.

 # Implementation
 
 We have implement this SPPMiner model in C/C++ and Java programming language.
